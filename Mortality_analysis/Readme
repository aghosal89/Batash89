To run the FSI model, first we read all the functions from the following scripts:

1) data_functions.R
2) FSIAuxFunctions.R
3) FSIDenReg.R
4) LocWassRegAMP.R

Then we run the codes in the script 'Data_analyses.R' to build the models Global Fréchet and Local Fréchet models using each covariates considered in the model: 
Year-on-year percentage change in GDP, Healthcare expenditure as percentage of GDP, CO2 emissions in tonnes per capita, Infant mortality per 1000 births, Human 
Development Index; all for the year 2013. 

Then, run the codes in the script 'FSI_model.R' script. We obtain the bandwidth choice, then obtain the estimate the of index parameter using the chosen bandwidth, 
then obtain the MSPE (Mean Square Prediction Error) for FSI model for various test/train splits of the dataset. Apart from the FSI model, . These codes for these models are in the script 'Data_analyses.R'. 

To obtain the fréchet R-squared for various regression models, run the script 'Frechet_Rsquared.R'.
